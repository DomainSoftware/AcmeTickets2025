# [Feature 5792851: Publish Refined Characteristics - OperatorRisk](https://dev.azure.com/InsuranceCo/PACE%20and%20PURE/_workitems/edit/5792851)

## Background
- Once the raw data elements have been refined into characteristic values, we need to be able to indicate that those refined characteristic values are ready and provide those values so that they can be used in developing the rate.
- This should be done all at once for every characteristic.
- As we develop characteristics, this enabler will allow us to easily apply this to the new characteristics.

## Considerations
1. How will we know that the refined characteristic values are ready?
1. How will we know if the refined characteristic values are complete?
1. What kinds of errors could happen throughout this process and how will we handle them?
1. What interactions/coordination do we have or need to have with other domains/teams?
