# :wave: Welcome to sPACE Jam

sPACE JAM is committed to these values

- Quality

- Respect 

- Valuable Communication

- :fire: Daily Sound offs :fire: 

# Working Agreement
All team members are expected to attend DSU - start time is 9:01 am EST

- DSU is restricted to 15 minutes and an optional 15 minute solutioning session (After-party). If an after party is needed, the person requesting it must identify who is needed and let the rest of the team leave.

Participation in team retrospectives is key to continuous improvement; Retro board should be available at the start of each sprint to allow team members to add items throughout the sprint.

If communication requires several back-and-forth then call

ADO comments needing support or for raising team awareness use the @<Name> so everyone is notified of the comment.

No meetings during lunch 12-1 EST

“I am not your enemy” - we are passionate delivering high-quality outcomes and helping the team deliver our objectives. We don’t take that passion out on people.

ADO Primary Assignment will reflect the person working on it currently. The Assignee section must be filled out as soon as possible.

The team is committed to expanding skillsets to become a cross-functional team

How will we ensure the team has enough time/capacity dedicated to backlog work, development, and testing?** 


- Reduce capacity by x% to allow for US creation

- Utilize spikes and enabler US to do this work. (Risk here is having to demo this/Admin overhead)

 

# Definition of Ready
What makes a user story ready for development?

Apply the necessary items from the Dev Ready Checklist included below

Agreement from team that AC and Story Points are ready; Product Owner has reviewed and agrees

Workflow is set to dev ready

Test data is ready, if needed

Dependencies are identified and planned so that they will not block progress on the story

 

Definition of Done
What criteria must be satisfied for a user story to be DONE?

AC satisfied; If US is technical then “testing not needed” to be included in the story

Acceptance tests pass

Product Owner accepts the story and AC

No bugs; If a bug exists then severity is determined and accepted by Product Owner. No showstopper bugs.

If needed, story is planned for demo. Demo tag - possibly added during grooming, during sprinting, or Shawn to assign at PO Review***

Testing Execution results must be included as attachment

**Takeaways 

# Dev Ready Checklist 
Title: Verify the title matches the intent of the story and it's understandable to the team

Description:  Filled out in the "As a User, I want to …, so that…" format. 

Users should be: EDGE, Policy Management (Duck Creek), Domain.. (May also be developer/Analyst for design/analysis stories)

Needs to reflect the intent of the story and is clear as to what needs to be developed, designed or documented

o   Does this match the feature expectations? 

o   Which Feature level acceptance criteria will this match to?

Fill out below:

Role(s): EDGE, POLICY MANAGEMENT (DUCK CREEK), DOMAIN

Impacted Field(s):

Impacted page(s):

Impacted DomainsI(s):

Dependencies: N/A

Illustrative output? (Is there a screenshot of a tech spec or other exhibit that would be helpful to the dev/tester?)

Link diagrams/ Tech Specs where applicable

Will they need to be updated as a result of the US?

Tags:  Make sure tags are updated…Sprint and whether or not it's a technical only story. The PI tag must also be added (ex. PI 22-2)

Acceptance Criteria: Draft Acceptance criteria (needs enough detail for tester to test when development is complete)..Should be in a "Given, When, Then" format where possible

Reviewed with PO?

Reviewed with Tester? (Would recommend doing this separate from a group grooming session)

Reviewed with Dev?

Workflow set to Analysis complete

Links

Feature: Is the correct feature linked as the "Parent"

Dependency:  Is this a dependency for any other story or is it dependent on another story?

Tasks

Create Analysts task and estimate hours, if needed. Analyst tasks are only needed when expecting to work on items satisfying the acceptance criteria (ex. create/ update tech specs, sequence diagrams). 

Ask tester to add tasks and estimate hours in advance of setting to dev ready

Devs - Once you have completed your analysis and all other work is finished - send a note to the dev group to review and add task where possible.
