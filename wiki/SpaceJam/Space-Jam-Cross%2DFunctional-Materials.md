For looking at an existing look up..
 
1.	Start with the RDS_Lookups_usage spreadsheet to identify the look up you are referencing and the parameters
 
2.	Then pull up the URL for the specific environment you are looking for 
 
3.	Then copy the href link into the RDS Dashboard
 
4.	Be sure to replace the bracketed date with what you are looking for
 
5.	Select table
 
6.	Select invoke
 
 
Tips:  you cannot hard code using an existing lookupsâ€¦If you have additional or missing parameters that need to be added you must request a new look up.  
 
To do this you must: 
a.	Request permission from the table owner
b.	Once approved you must submit a request to the RDS team.  This will always go into their next sprint so there is a 3 week lead time that is needed.
